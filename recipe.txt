Crack the eggs into a measuring jug.

Add a tiny pinch of salt and pepper, then use a fork to beat them together
well. Mix it with the milk.

Put a medium saucepan over a low heat (150 °C) and add the butter.

Leave it to melt slowly, then when it starts to bubble carefully pour in
the eggs.

Stir slowly with a wooden spoon, or a spatula if you’ve got one, so you can
get right to the edges of the pan.

Keep gently stirring until the eggs still look silky, slightly runny and
slightly underdone, and then remove from the heat – the heat of the pan will
continue to cook the eggs 2 minutes.

Serve with lightly buttered toast.
